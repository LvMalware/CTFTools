# CTF Tools

Some useful tools for CTF competitions.

This repository will be updated with new tools as I write them.

Avaiable tools:

repeated_key_xor.pl -- attempts to break repeated key xor encryption on text, based on the frequency of english characters.

RSA_tool.pl         -- encrypts and/or decrypts text using RSA, also can search the factors of N on a
factor database.


# TO DO 

- Add to RSA_tool.pl more methods to factorize N
- Add more tools (of course)
